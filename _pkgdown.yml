  - title: "Functional Data Analysis and Utilities for Statistical Computing (fda.usc)"
    desc: >
      This devel version carries out exploratory and descriptive analysis of functional
	    data exploring its most important features: such as depth measurements or
	    functional outliers detection, among others.  It also helps to explain
	    and model the relationship between a dependent variable and independent
	    (regression models) and make predictions. Methods for supervised or
	    unsupervised classification of a set of functional data regarding a feature
	    of the data are also included. Finally, it can perform analysis of variance
	    model (ANOVA) for functional data.

      Functional Data Representation  The functions included in this
      section allow to define, transform, manipulate and represent a functional
      dataset in many ways including derivatives, non-parametric kernel methods or
      basis representation.

      This section allows the Functional Supervised Classification estimation of
      the groups in a training set of functional data fdata class by 
      different nonparametric methods of supervised classification. Once these 
      classifiers have been trained, they can be used to predict on new
      functional data.  Package allows the estimation of the groups in a
      training set of functional data by different methods of supervised 
      classification.
